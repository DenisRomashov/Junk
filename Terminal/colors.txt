Customizing LSCOLORS Manually
If the above color choices weren’t doing it for you, you can set whatever you want. Here’s the manual page on LSCOLORS if you want to give it a shot. The default is “exfxcxdxbxegedabagacad” but clearing out the .bash_profile color entry will remove any hideous color combinations too.

LSCOLORS The value of this variable describes what color to use
for which attribute when colors are enabled with
CLICOLOR. This string is a concatenation of pairs of the
format fb, where f is the foreground color and b is the
background color.

The color designators are as follows:

a black
b red
c green
d brown
e blue
f magenta
g cyan
h light grey
A bold black, usually shows up as dark grey
B bold red
C bold green
D bold brown, usually shows up as yellow
E bold blue
F bold magenta
G bold cyan
H bold light grey; looks like bright white
x default foreground or background

Note that the above are standard ANSI colors. The actual
display may differ depending on the color capabilities of
the terminal in use.

The order of the attributes are as follows:

1. directory
2. symbolic link
3. socket
4. pipe
5. executable
6. block special
7. character special
8. executable with setuid bit set
9. executable with setgid bit set
10. directory writable to others, with sticky bit
11. directory writable to others, without sticky
bit

The default is “exfxcxdxbxegedabagacad”, i.e. blue fore-
ground and default background for regular directories,
black foreground and red background for setuid executa-
bles, etc.
